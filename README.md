Tic-tac-toe app created with React.

## Motivation

This project was created for learning purposes. Learning by doing for me is extremely productive. 

### What I've learned

* How to made application with React
    * React hooks
    * React testing with jest
      - Code Coverage
* How to build and deploy page to github pages

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
Run coverage test with ```npm run test-coverage```.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
